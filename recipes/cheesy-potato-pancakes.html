            <ol>
                <li>Fill a 5 Qt pot with water. Add 1 Tbsp salt and peeled quartered russet potatoes (2 lbs or about 7 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered). 
                    Cook until easily pierced with fork. Drain well and mash in 4 Tbsp butter then let cool to room temp. 
                    Mashed potatoes can be made 1 - 3 days ahead.

            <p>How to make mashed potato pancakes</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 4 cups mashed potatoes, 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, 1 large egg, 1/4 cup flour and 2 Tbsp chopped chives. 
                    Use a potato masher to mash the mixture together until well mixed. 
                    If the potatoes are too loose to hold a patty shape, add flour a Tablespoon at a time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place a heaping tablespoonful of potato mixture between your palms and form into a round, 1/3" thick patty. Dredge both sides of the pancake in bread crumbs and set on a cutting board. Repeat with remaining pancakes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat with enough oil to lightly cover the bottom of the pan. Once oil is hot, add patties in a single layer and sauté 3-4 minutes per side or until golden brown. Repeat with remaining patties, adding more oil as needed. I usually have 2 skillets going at once to finish sooner.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <h4>Recipe Notes</h4>
        <p>*Recipe works best with mashed potatoes that aren't super creamy. If they are very moist, you may need a little more flour for them to hold a patty shape. Do not use instant mashed potatoes.</p>
