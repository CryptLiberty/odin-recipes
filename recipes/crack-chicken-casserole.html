        <h3>Recipe Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Rotisserie Chicken</strong>: Picking up a rotisserie chicken from the store makes this recipe so easy! I also love how tender and flavorful rotisserie chicken is, it makes this casserole even yummier!</li>

            <li><strong>Use Homemade Ranch Mix</strong>: Prepackaged ranch mix works great if you already have it on hand, but if you really want to take this recipe up a notch, try making your own blend of ranch seasoning mix! It has the most amazing flavor and is free of preservatives and artificial flavors! <!--You can find a full recipe ##add ranch recipe <a href="">here</a> --></li>

            <li><strong>Grate Your Own Cheese</strong>: If you want the best possible flavor for your crack chicken casserole, grate your own cheese! It melts better and has a creamier flavor.</li>
