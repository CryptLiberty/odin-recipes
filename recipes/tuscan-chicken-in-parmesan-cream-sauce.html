                <li><strong>Fresh parsley for garnish</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Season each side of each pounded chicken breast with Italian Seasoning and salt and pepper.</li>

                <li>
                    Combine flour and grated parmesan in a shallow bowl. Dredge each chicken breast in the flour mixture, coating both sides.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the 2 tablespoons butter and stir/melt.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Cook the chicken (in batches if necessary) for 4-5 minutes per side or until its fully cooked (165F in the center and no longer pink) and browned on both sides. Remove from the skillet and place on a plate. Cover with foil.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Wipe the skillet clean and return the skillet to medium high heat and add the remaining ¼ cup butter. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the pan as the butter melts. The brown bits hold a lot of flavor, so no need to remove.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add the garlic and sun-dried tomatoes and cook for 1-2 minutes or until fragrant.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Whisk in the flour and allow to thicken for approximately 1 minute.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Whisk in the heavy cream, chicken broth, parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, and pepper. Stir to combine.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add the spinach and reduce heat to simmer. Allow to cook until the sauce slightly thickens and the spinach wilts.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add the chicken back into the skillet and turn to coat in the sauce. Allow to continue to simmer until the chicken is heated through, 2-3 minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley.
                </li>
                
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cook your chicken in batches if needs be, so you don’t overcrowd your pan.</li>

                <li>You can also use chicken thighs. Make sure to check doneness.</li>

                <li>You can check the doneness of your chicken by inserting a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken – it should read at least 165F.</li>

                <li>After cooking the chicken and just before making the sauce, use a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the pan as the butter melts. The brown bits hold a lot of flavor, so no need to remove.</li>

                <li>Heavy cream will make the thickest richest sauce.</li>

                <li>Garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
            </ul>
